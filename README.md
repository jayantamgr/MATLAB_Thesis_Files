Below is the abstract.

In this work an Auto Guided Vehicles (AGV)
scheduling and routing problem is considered with maximal and
minimal time lags along with heterogeneous characteristics. A
framework with dynamic flow control has been proposed for the
execution of events dedicated to a fleet of AGVs. The proposed
framework allows the setting up for missions which are defined by
a set of routes and stations regardless of the actual characteristics
of the AGV fleet.
The routing and scheduling method is formulated with potential
inequalities and disjunctive constraints, which are expressed
in Max Plus Algebra in terms of inequalities. The computation of
the eigenvalue of the corresponding matrices takes the advantage
of the fast Howardâ€™s algorithm for policy iteration. The Branch
and Bound procedure is used to solve medium sized routing and
scheduling problems involves a test on this eigenvalue.
